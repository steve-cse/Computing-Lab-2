This Java program represents a basic client-server application. The `Client` class establishes a connection with a server running on the localhost at port 8989. The client sends messages to the server and receives responses.

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. Importing necessary classes:
```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;
```

2. Defining the `Client` class:
```java
public class Client implements Runnable {
```

3. Declaring static variables for the client:
```java
static Socket clientSocket = null;
static PrintStream os = null;
static DataInputStream is = null;
static BufferedReader br = null;
static boolean closed = false;
```

4. The `main` method starts the client application:
```java
public static void main(String args[]) {
```

5. Setting up the client's connection with the server:
```java
int PORT = 8989;
String HOST = "localhost";

// Attempt to create a socket connection to the server
try {
    clientSocket = new Socket(HOST, PORT);
    // Set up streams for communication
    br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    os = new PrintStream(clientSocket.getOutputStream());
    is = new DataInputStream(clientSocket.getInputStream());
}
```

6. The client reads input from the user and sends messages to the server:
```java
try {
    // Start a new thread to receive responses from the server
    new Thread(new Client()).start();

    while (!closed) {
        // Read input from the user
        str = br.readLine();

        // Process the input and send messages to the server
        if (str.contains("/")) {
            if (str.contains("/0"))
                os.println("ABORT");
            else
                os.println("COMMIT");
        } else
            os.println(str);
    }

    // Close streams and socket after use
    os.close();
    is.close();
    clientSocket.close();
}
```

7. The `run` method runs in a separate thread to receive responses from the server:
```java
@Override
public void run() {
    String response;
    try {
        // Loop to read responses from the server until it receives "GLOBAL_COMMIT" or "GLOBAL_ABORT"
        while ((response = is.readLine()) != null) {
            System.out.println("\n" + response);
            if (response.equalsIgnoreCase("GLOBAL_COMMIT") || response.equalsIgnoreCase("GLOBAL_ABORT"))
                break;
        }
        closed = true;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

In summary, the `Client` class connects to a server, allows the user to input messages, sends those messages to the server, and receives responses from the server, which are then displayed on the client's console. The server's responses can trigger the client to close its connection and terminate the application.
